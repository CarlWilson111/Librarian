The 1007 assertion\njust happens to cross-check the results of huge numbers of\nmemory reads/writes, and so acts (unintendedly) as a stress\ntest of your memory system.\n\nI suggest the following: try compressing the file again,\npossibly monitoring progress in detail with the -vv flag.\n\n* If the error cannot be reproduced, and/or happens at different\n  points in compression, you may have a flaky memory system.\n  Try a memory-test program.  I have used Memtest86\n  (www.memtest86.com).  At the time of writing it is free (GPLd).\n  Memtest86 tests memory much more thorougly than your BIOSs\n  power-on test, and may find failures that the BIOS doesn't.\n\n* If the error can be repeatably reproduced, this is a bug in\n  bzip2, and I would very much like to hear about it.  Please\n  let me know, and, ideally, save a copy of the file causing the\n  problem -- without which I will be unable to investigate it.\n\n", "SEQUENCE_ERROR", "PARAM_ERROR", "MEM_ERROR", "DATA_ERROR", "DATA_ERROR_MAGIC", "IO_ERROR", "UNEXPECTED_EOF", "OUTBUFF_FULL", "CONFIG_ERROR"], "stringidentifiers": ["SEQUENCE_ERROR", "PARAM_ERROR", "MEM_ERROR", "DATA_ERROR", "DATA_ERROR_MAGIC", "IO_ERROR", "UNEXPECTED_EOF", "OUTBUFF_FULL", "CONFIG_ERROR"], "debugstrings": ["GCC: (GNU) 4.7.3"], "localsymbols": [""], "dependencies": ["libc.so.6"], "elfname": "libbz2.so.1"}
